# Improving Code Modularity and Extensibility for a Multi-Game Engine

## Current Architecture Assessment

The slot game engine currently follows a modular approach with clear separation between UI components, animation systems, game logic, and configuration. The codebase is already well-structured with:

- Centralized state management through `GameState.js`
- Configuration-driven game parameters
- Separation of concerns between UI, animations, and game logic
- A flexible animation system using GSAP

However, to support a **production-ready engine** designed for **multiple future games**, further enhancements are needed to improve extensibility, clarity, and robustness.

## Goals

1. Improve code comprehension for new developers joining future game projects
2. Reduce coupling between core engine modules and game-specific features
3. Standardize interfaces and interactions between components
4. Make the system highly extensible for new game mechanics and features via plugins
5. Simplify the process of creating and configuring new slot game variants
6. Enhance robustness and maintainability for production environments
7. Prepare architecture for seamless integration with an authoritative backend server, while maintaining current functionality via mocking initially.

## Proposed Improvements

*(Summary of improvements: EventBus, JSDoc, Lifecycles, AnimationController, FeatureManager, PluginSystem, DI, Config Management, Logging, Server Prep Strategy, Performance Awareness - Details omitted for brevity in final update, refer to original plan if needed)*

## Implementation Plan Status (As of March 30)

*   [x] **Task 3.2:** Inject `AnimationController` into `Game` class.
*   [x] **Task 3.3:** **Refactor `Animations` module:** Injected deps, added logging, registered logic with `AnimationController`.
*   [x] **Task 3.4:** **Refactor `UIManager` (Win Animation):** Injected deps, added logging, registered `animateWin` with `AnimationController`.
*   [x] **Task 3.5:** Refactor `WinEvaluation` (Role changed, logic moved/refactored into `ApiService` mock and `ResultHandler`).
*   [x] **Task 3.6:** Refactor `PaylineGraphics` (Subscribes to `paylines:show`, uses GSAP).
*   [ ] **Task 3.7:** Update integration tests for the win flow (Pending - Requires Integration Test Setup).

### Phase 3.5: Integration & Fixes - COMPLETE

*   [x] **Task 3.5.1:** Refactor `TurboMode` -> `TurboPlugin`.
*   [x] **Task 3.5.2:** Refactor `Autoplay` -> `AutoplayPlugin`.
*   [x] **Task 3.5.3:** Refactor `FreeSpins` -> `FreeSpinsPlugin`.
*   [x] **Task 3.5.4:** Handle UI Button Events (`GameState` or relevant modules/plugins updated).
*   [x] **Task 3.5.5:** Refactor `WinEvaluation` (Addressed in Phase 2/3).
*   [x] **Task 3.5.6:** Refactor `PaylineGraphics` (Addressed in Phase 3).
*   [x] **Task 3.5.7:** Refactor/Cleanup `Animations.js` (Addressed in Phase 3 & GSAP Integration).
*   [x] **Task 3.5.8:** Fix Core Module Initializations (`Game.js`) (Including `Notifications`, `InfoOverlay`, `DebugPanel`).

*   [x] **Task 4.1:** Implement `PluginSystem` class.
*   [x] **Task 4.2:** Integrate `PluginSystem` into `Game.js`.
*   [ ] **Task 4.3:** Implement Multi-Game Configuration loader.

### Phase 5: Error Handling, Polish, Performance & Final Documentation - PENDING

## Conclusion & Next Steps

The core modularity refactoring (Phases 1-3.5) is largely complete. The engine is now significantly more decoupled, event-driven, uses plugins for major features, and is architecturally prepared for server integration (currently using mocks).

**Outstanding tasks from this plan primarily involve:**

*   Multi-game configuration management (Phase 4)
*   Advanced logging configuration/reporting (Phase 4)
*   Robust error handling (Phase 5)
*   Performance profiling/optimization (Phase 5)
*   Full documentation (Phase 5)
*   Integration testing (Phase 3 & 5)

**Recommended immediate next steps (addressing other known issues/goals):**

1.  **Audio Integration:** Implement sound effects.
2.  **Button Graphics Overhaul:** Replace Graphics buttons with Sprites.
3.  **API Configuration:** Prepare `ApiService` for real endpoint URL/auth.
