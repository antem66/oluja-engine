# V2 Slot Engine: Implementation Roadmap Overview

## 1. Introduction

This roadmap outlines the phased implementation plan for building the V2 Slot Engine, based on the architecture defined in the `docs/v2/` documentation suite. The goal is to deliver a high-end, extensible, and production-ready engine incrementally.

## 2. Roadmap Philosophy

*   **Incremental Delivery:** Each phase aims to deliver a functional, testable subset of the engine or a demonstrably working game feature.
*   **Architecture Validation:** Early phases focus on validating the core architectural decisions (monorepo setup, React/Pixi integration, state management, configuration system).
*   **Risk Reduction:** Tackle core technical challenges early (rendering pipeline, state flow, basic animation) **and integrate with the server early** to validate communication and authority.
*   **Feedback Loops:** Allow for review and potential adjustments at the end of key phases.
*   **Parallel Potential:** While phases are sequential, some tasks within later phases (e.g., developing different game configs/assets, concurrent client/server feature development) can potentially be parallelized.

## 3. Phases Overview (Revised Sequence)

1.  **Phase 1: Foundation Setup (`01-phase-foundation.md`)**
    *   Goal: Establish the monorepo, core packages, build system, essential types, and basic tooling.
    *   Outcome: A working monorepo structure where packages can be built and depend on each other.
2.  **Phase 2: Core Rendering & Static Display (`02-phase-core-rendering.md`)**
    *   Goal: Implement the basic rendering pipeline using React/Pixi, asset loading, and display a static game scene based on configuration.
    *   Outcome: Ability to render a static grid of symbols using assets and layout defined in a game config.
3.  **Phase 3: State Management & Basic Interaction (`03-phase-state-interaction.md`)**
    *   Goal: Integrate Zustand, establish core state structure, implement basic UI elements (Spin Button), and link UI interactions to state changes.
    *   Outcome: A static scene where UI elements can trigger state updates.
4.  **Phase 4: Standard Game Loop & Animation (`04-phase-standard-game-loop.md`)**
    *   Goal: Implement the standard spin cycle logic (*client-side mock results initially*), basic reel spin/stop animations (GSAP), line win evaluation (client-side), and basic win presentation.
    *   Outcome: A minimally playable visual loop: Spin -> Reels Animate -> Stop -> Show Line Wins (based on mock data).
5.  **Phase 5: Basic Server Integration (`05-phase-basic-server-integration.md`)** - **NEW**
    *   Goal: Implement `ApiService`. Connect the basic spin cycle to a minimal working `game-server` endpoint. Replace client-side mock results with authoritative server results for a standard spin. Establish basic session initialization.
    *   Outcome: Spin action triggers server request; results/state are updated from server response. Core client-server loop validated.
6.  **Phase 6: First Game MVP (was Phase 5) (`06-phase-first-game-mvp.md`)**
    *   Goal: Fully configure `heavens-ten-deluxe-react`. Refine UI, integrate full sound set, polish standard animations *using server-driven results*. Implement simple game-specific visuals/presentation.
    *   Outcome: A complete, playable MVP of the first standard game, validated against server results.
7.  **Phase 7: Engine Feature Enhancements (was Phase 6) (`07-phase-engine-features.md`)**
    *   Goal: Implement core reusable engine features (Standard Free Spins, Autoplay, Turbo, Feature Buy framework) **ensuring correct integration with server-side state/triggers.** Requires concurrent server support.
    *   Outcome: Engine supports common slot features, working correctly with server authority.
8.  **Phase 8: Advanced Mechanic Support (was Phase 7) (`08-phase-advanced-mechanics.md`)**
    *   Goal: Extend `engine-core` **and `game-server` concurrently** to support different mechanics (Tumbling, Ways, Clusters, Megaways). Implement needed config changes, engine logic, and server logic.
    *   Outcome: Engine and server can handle diverse game mechanics.
9.  **Phase 9: Multi-Game Validation (was Phase 8) (`09-phase-multi-game-validation.md`)**
    *   Goal: Implement MVPs for 1-2 additional diverse games (e.g., Tumbling, Ways) using the enhanced engine **and server capabilities** to validate the full architecture and workflow.
    *   Outcome: High confidence in the engine's extensibility and the game creation process for varied game types.
10. **Phase 10: Production Hardening (was Phase 9) (`10-phase-production-hardening.md`)**
    *   Goal: Focus on comprehensive testing, performance optimization, error handling refinement, accessibility improvements, security considerations, and final documentation polish.
    *   Outcome: A robust, performant, well-tested engine ready for production game deployment.

## 4. Tracking Progress & Iteration

*   **Task Management:** Use a project management tool (Jira, Asana, Linear, GitHub Projects) to break down the steps within each phase into specific tasks assigned to developers.
*   **Source Control:** Use Git, with feature branches for significant work, pull requests for code reviews, and merging upon completion/approval.
*   **Definition of Done:** Each major step/task should have a clear definition of done, often including implementation, code review, testing, and documentation updates.
*   **Phase Gates:** Conduct reviews at the end of each phase to ensure goals are met, validate the architecture holds, and approve moving to the next phase. This allows for course correction if needed.
*   **Documentation Updates:** The `docs/v2/` documentation should be treated as a living document, updated as implementation details are finalized or refined during development.
*   **Regular Demos:** Demonstrate progress at regular intervals (e.g., end of sprints or phases) to stakeholders.

This roadmap provides the high-level structure. The subsequent documents detail the specific steps, deliverables, and considerations for each phase.
