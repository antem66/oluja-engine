# Roadmap: Phase 10 - Production Hardening

**Reference Docs:**
*   `docs/v2/09-testing-strategy.md`
*   `docs/v2/10-performance-optimization.md`
*   `docs/v2/02-engine-core-deep-dive.md` (Error Handling, Accessibility)
*   All other `docs/v2/*` documentation.

**Goal:** Prepare the engine core and validated game MVPs for production deployment by focusing on comprehensive testing, performance optimization across devices, robust error handling, accessibility improvements, security considerations, and final documentation polish.

**Prerequisites:** Phase 9 (Multi-Game Validation) Completed. Multiple game MVPs are functional and validated.

**Outcome:**
*   A stable, performant, well-tested, and secure V2 engine core.
*   Production-ready builds of the initial set of games.
*   Comprehensive test suites providing high confidence.
*   Finalized and polished technical documentation.
*   Established processes for performance monitoring and error reporting.

**Key Steps & Tasks:**

1.  **Comprehensive Testing:**
    *   `[Task]` Review and enhance unit test coverage across all packages (`engine-core`, `shared-utils`, `games/*`), aiming for high coverage on critical logic.
    *   `[Task]` Expand integration tests (RTL, Vitest/Jest) for key component interactions and feature flows within `engine-core` and `games/*`.
    *   `[Task]` Develop and execute E2E test suites (Playwright/Cypress) covering critical user paths for each validated game MVP (Load -> Bet -> Spin -> Win -> Feature Entry/Exit).
    *   `[Task]` Perform cross-browser and cross-device testing (manual and/or automated via cloud services) focusing on layout, performance, and interaction consistency, especially on target mobile devices.
    *   `[Task]` Conduct load testing on the `game-server` integration points if applicable.
2.  **Performance Optimization:**
    *   `[Task]` Profile game performance using Browser DevTools and React DevTools on target desktop and mobile devices for each game MVP.
    *   `[Task]` Identify and address bottlenecks based on profiling data, applying techniques from `docs/v2/10...` (Texture Atlases, draw calls, JS optimization, React re-renders, memory usage).
    *   `[Task]` Optimize asset sizes (images, sounds) for production delivery.
    *   `[Task]` Verify loading times are within acceptable limits, especially on mobile networks.
3.  **Error Handling & Logging:**
    *   `[Task]` Implement or refine React Error Boundaries in `engine-core` and potentially game entry points.
    *   `[Task]` Ensure robust error handling in `ApiService` for all potential server/network issues.
    *   `[Task]` Implement user-friendly display of critical errors (using `<ErrorOverlay>` or similar).
    *   `[Task]` Integrate a production-grade remote logging/error reporting service (e.g., Sentry) to capture client-side exceptions and context.
4.  **Accessibility (a11y) Improvements:**
    *   `[Task]` Implement keyboard navigation for all core UI controls.
    *   `[Task]` Implement ARIA attributes for dynamic announcements of key game states (as outlined in `docs/v2/02...`).
    *   `[Task]` Perform basic accessibility checks using browser tools or automated checkers.
5.  **Security Considerations:**
    *   `[Task]` Review client-server communication: ensure appropriate use of HTTPS, validate data received from server (if necessary beyond type safety), sanitize any user input if applicable.
    *   `[Task]` **(Server-Side Focus)** Ensure `game-server` has robust security measures (authentication, authorization, input validation, protection against common web vulnerabilities).
    *   `[Task]` Check dependencies for known vulnerabilities (`pnpm audit`).
6.  **Build & Deployment:**
    *   `[Task]` Finalize production build configurations in Vite for optimization (minification, tree shaking, code splitting).
    *   `[Task]` Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, building, and deployment of game packages.
7.  **Documentation Polish:**
    *   `[Task]` Review all `docs/v2/` and `docs/v2-roadmap/` documents for clarity, accuracy, and completeness based on final implementation.
    *   `[Task]` Add README files to each package explaining its purpose and usage.
    *   `[Task]` Consider generating API documentation from TSDoc comments if applicable.

**Definition of Done:**
*   Comprehensive test suites (unit, integration, E2E) are implemented and passing.
*   Performance profiling completed, and identified major bottlenecks addressed.
*   Robust error handling and remote logging are in place.
*   Accessibility improvements (keyboard nav, ARIA) are implemented.
*   Security review completed.
*   Production build process and CI/CD pipelines are operational.
*   All technical documentation is reviewed, finalized, and polished.
*   Engine and initial game(s) are deemed production-ready by the team and stakeholders.

**Tracking:**
*   Create detailed tickets for testing, optimization, hardening tasks.
*   Track bug fixing and performance improvements.
*   Final code reviews and documentation reviews.
*   Final sign-off/release readiness review.
