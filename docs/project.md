1. Vision & Goals

Vision: To evolve the existing PixiJS-based slot engine ("The Engine") into a highly performant, visually spectacular, feature-rich, and robust platform ("Phoenix Engine") capable of powering slot games that rival those from leading studios like Pragmatic Play and Hacksaw Gaming.

Goals:

Achieve top-tier performance and smoothness across desktop and mobile.

Enable stunning visual effects, animations, and high-fidelity graphics.

Implement a rich, immersive audio experience.

Support a wide range of modern and innovative slot features.

Establish a flexible architecture for rapid game development and iteration.

Integrate seamlessly with a server-side backend for real-money gaming (RNG) and compliance.

Create a highly polished and engaging player experience ("juice").

2. Current State Analysis (How the Code Works)

The Engine is currently a functional client-side slot machine simulator built with PixiJS and modern JavaScript.

Core (/core):

Game.js: The main orchestrator. Initializes PixiJS, sets up containers (reels, UI, overlays), creates Reel instances, manages the game loop (update), and handles the spin start/end logic (startSpinLoop, handleSpinEnd). It uses performance.now() and scheduled stop times for reel coordination.

Reel.js: Manages a single reel. It holds symbol graphics (PIXI.Containers containing Symbol instances), manages its position on a virtual strip, and controls its state (idle, accelerating, spinning, tweeningStop, stopped). It uses a sophisticated time-based tweening approach (scheduleStop, lerpAngle, easeOutQuad) to land precisely on a stopIndex. Currently, this stopIndex is generated randomly client-side. It applies a blur filter during spins. Symbol alignment logic (alignReelSymbols) replaces symbol graphics as the reel spins.

GameState.js: A simple module holding the central state object (state) including balance, bet, win, spin status, feature flags (Autoplay, Turbo, Free Spins). Provides updateState for centralized modification and initGameState for reset.

Symbol.js: Represents a single symbol. Currently, it extends PIXI.Container and draws the symbol using PIXI.Graphics based on definitions (symbolDefinitions.js). It holds the symbolId.

UI (/ui):

UIManager.js: Manages updates to core PIXI Text elements (balance, bet, win) based on GameState. It also handles enabling/disabling buttons and updating their visual state (autoplay/turbo active colors) by accessing button instances created by ButtonFactory.

ButtonFactory.js: Creates reusable button components (Button class extending PIXI.Container). Buttons are currently drawn using PIXI.Graphics for different states (idle, hover, down). Handles basic pointer events. Can create circular buttons and includes logic for a specific 'spin' icon graphic.

ButtonHandlers.js: Contains the event handler functions called by the buttons (e.g., increaseBet, toggleAutoplay, startSpin). These functions interact with GameState (via updateState) and trigger actions in other modules (Game.js, UIManager.js). startSpin includes basic balance checks.

InfoOverlay.js: Manages a DOM element outside the Pixi canvas to display Autoplay/Free Spins status. Updated via updateInfoOverlay based on GameState.

Notifications.js: Handles displaying temporary overlay messages (showOverlayMessage using PIXI.Text) and flashing elements (flashElement by manipulating tint) within a dedicated Pixi container.

Features (/features):

WinEvaluation.js: Calculates wins after reels stop. It gets the visible symbol grid (getResultsGrid) based on reel stopIndexes, iterates through PAYLINES, compares symbols against the PAYTABLE, sums wins, and identifies winning lines/symbols. It also checks for scatter counts. Triggers win display updates, line drawing, and animations. Crucially, it depends on client-side determined results. Includes logic to trigger enterFreeSpins if enabled and enough scatters land.

PaylineGraphics.js: Draws winning paylines using PIXI.Graphics based on the winning symbol positions provided by WinEvaluation. Includes basic fade-in/fade-out logic using setInterval/setTimeout.

Animations.js: Handles win presentation. animateWinningSymbols provides a basic scale bounce effect (currently direct scale setting with setTimeout). playWinAnimations shows large text overlays for Big/Mega wins (animated via setInterval) and triggers basic particle effects (createParticles, updateParticles using PIXI.Graphics).

FreeSpins.js: Manages the free spins state. enterFreeSpins updates state, shows an overlay, changes the background color, and starts the first spin. handleFreeSpinEnd updates the total FS win, decrements spins, and either starts the next spin or calls exitFreeSpins. exitFreeSpins shows a summary and resets the state/background.

Autoplay.js: handleAutoplayNextSpin checks conditions (spins remaining, balance) and schedules the next spin via setTimeout or stops autoplay.

TurboMode.js: Primarily intended to modify animation timings (though current implementation mainly references settings directly). applyTurboSettings is called when toggled.

Configuration (/config): Centralizes game settings, paylines, symbol definitions, animation timings, and reel strips. This is well-structured.

Utilities (/utils): Contains helper functions like lerpAngle and easing functions.

Entry Point (/main.js): Initializes the Game class when the DOM is ready.

Strengths:

Good modular structure foundation.

Centralized state management (GameState.js).

Modern JavaScript (ES Modules) and PixiJS usage.

Advanced, precise time-based reel stop mechanism (Reel.js).

Clear separation of configuration data.

Basic implementations of core features (FS, Autoplay, Turbo).

Weaknesses:

Performance Bottleneck: Heavy reliance on PIXI.Graphics for symbols and buttons is inefficient.

Visual Fidelity: Limited by PIXI.Graphics; lacks textures, spritesheets, and advanced effects.

Audio: Completely absent – a major gap in player experience.

Animation Quality: Basic, often uses setInterval/setTimeout, lacking smoothness, complexity, and robust control (needs a dedicated library like GSAP).

Client-Side RNG: Fundamentally unsuitable for real-money or fair-play scenarios. Requires server-side result determination.

Limited Features: Lacks common modern slot features (cascades, advanced wilds, complex bonuses, anticipation).

Lack of Polish ("Juice"): Missing sophisticated visual/audio feedback, smooth transitions, satisfying win celebrations.

UI Limitations: Basic button component, inconsistent DOM overlay usage.

Development Tooling: No build system (Webpack/Vite) or testing framework apparent.

3. Target State Vision: Defining the "Phoenix Engine"

The Phoenix Engine should embody the following qualities:

Visually Stunning: Support for high-resolution spritesheets, intricate animations, shaders, and advanced particle effects. Easily skinnable for diverse game themes.

Immersive Audio: A rich, dynamic soundscape managed by a dedicated engine, reacting fluidly to game events.

Buttery Smooth Performance: Optimized rendering pipeline, efficient object pooling, smooth animations locked to the display refresh rate, even on mobile devices.

Feature-Rich & Flexible: Easily accommodate diverse gameplay mechanics (cascades, ways-to-win, expanding symbols, various bonus types) through a modular and extensible design.

Server-Driven: Reliant on a secure backend for spin results (RNG), ensuring fairness and regulatory compliance.

Highly Polished ("Juiced"): Abundant visual and auditory feedback for every player action and game event, creating a satisfying and engaging experience.

Developer-Friendly: Clear architecture, good tooling, and streamlined workflows for creating and configuring new games rapidly.

Cross-Platform: Performant and responsive on both desktop and mobile browsers.

5. Phased Action Plan

This plan prioritizes foundational changes first, then builds features and polish on top.

Phase 1: Foundation Overhaul (Estimated Time: TBD)

Objective: Replace core rendering/animation/audio systems, establish build process, and implement basic server communication hooks.

Key Tasks:

Setup Build System: Integrate Vite/Webpack. Configure dev/prod builds, asset handling.

Integrate GSAP: Add GSAP library. Refactor one simple animation (e.g., showOverlayMessage fade) to use GSAP via the Pixi ticker.

Graphics Overhaul - Symbols: Define texture atlas format. Create placeholder symbol textures. Refactor Symbol.js and Reel.js (alignReelSymbols) to use PIXI.Sprites and pooling.

Graphics Overhaul - Buttons: Create button state textures. Refactor ButtonFactory.js to use sprites.

Integrate Sound Engine: Add Howler.js/PixiSound. Create SoundManager.js. Implement basic sound playback for spin start/stop and button clicks. Load sounds via asset manager.

Server Hooks - Basic API: Define simple spin API (request bet -> receive stop positions). Modify ButtonHandlers.js (startSpin) to simulate sending a request and receiving hardcoded stop positions. Modify Reel.js to use these provided stops. (Full backend integration deferred).

Refactor Reel Stop: Migrate Reel.js tweening logic (lerpAngle, easeOutQuad) to use GSAP's tweening capabilities for potentially smoother results and more easing options.

Phase 2: Gameplay Core & Server Integration (Estimated Time: TBD)

Objective: Implement full server communication, core win presentation enhancements, and the first major feature (enhanced Free Spins).

Key Tasks:

Full Server Integration: Connect client spin request/response to a real (or mock) backend game server providing RNG results. Handle API states (loading, error).

Win Presentation - Basics: Refactor PaylineGraphics.js to use GSAP/animated sprites. Refactor animateWinningSymbols and playWinAnimations (Big Win) to use GSAP timelines for smoother, more controllable sequences. Implement animated win counter rollup.

Sound Design - Core Loop: Add distinct reel stop sounds, win sounds (small/medium/large), FS trigger sound.

Anticipation Logic: Implement basic reel anticipation effects (visual/audio) when 2 scatters land (requires server result pre-check).

Feature: Enhanced Free Spins: Implement FS retriggers and a simple win multiplier mechanic. Add distinct FS entry/exit transitions (using GSAP). Add FS background music loop.

UI Refinement: Implement basic interactive Paytable screen showing symbol payouts.

Phase 3: Testing & Verification (COMPLETED)

Objective: Ensure core features refactored in Phase 1 & 2 function correctly with mock logic.

Key Tasks:

Task 3.1: Test Normal Spins - DONE
*   Verify reel spin/stop.
*   Verify win display (mock logic).
*   Verify balance updates (deduction on spin, increase on win).
*   Check for console errors.

Task 3.2: Test Autoplay - DONE
*   Verify auto-start/stop.
*   Verify spin counter decrement.
*   Verify manual stop.
*   Check for console errors.

Task 3.3: Test Turbo Mode - DONE
*   Verify visual toggle state.
*   Verify increased spin/stop speed.
*   Verify toggle off restores normal speed.
*   Check for console errors.

Task 3.4: Test Free Spins - DONE
*   Trigger via Debug Panel.
*   Verify background/UI changes.
*   Verify automatic spin execution.
*   Verify win accumulation (mock).
*   Verify return to base game.
*   Check for console errors.

Phase 4: Prepare for Server Integration (Current)

Objective: Refactor client-side modules to remove mock result generation and prepare them to consume data provided by a server (via ApiService events).

Key Tasks:

Task 4.1: Refactor ResultHandler.js
*   Remove mock win calculation logic within `_processSpinResult`.
*   Modify `_processSpinResult` (or create a new handler) to accept spin result data (total win, winning lines, symbols to animate, feature triggers) as an argument (simulating data from a server event).
*   Ensure presentation events (`paylines:show`, `win:validatedForAnimation`, `win:evaluationComplete`) are still emitted, but based on the *received* data, not calculated data.

Phase 5: Server Integration & API Service Implementation

Objective: Implement full server communication and API service for the slot engine.

Key Tasks:

Task 5.1: Implement API communication for spin initiation and result reception.
Task 5.2: Develop a dedicated API service for handling game-related requests and responses.
Task 5.3: Ensure seamless integration with existing client-side logic and data flow.

6. Progress Tracking & Management

Tooling: Use a project management tool like Jira, Trello, Asana, or GitHub Projects. A Kanban board visualizing tasks in columns (Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Review, Done) is highly recommended.

Task Management:

Break down Phase tasks into smaller, manageable user stories or technical tasks within the chosen tool.

Assign owners to each task.

Estimate effort (Story Points or Time) for planning purposes.

Workflow:

Sprints/Cycles: Work in defined iterations (e.g., 1-2 weeks). Plan tasks for each sprint.

Daily Stand-ups: Brief daily check-ins to discuss progress, blockers, and next steps.

Code Reviews: Mandatory peer reviews for all code changes before merging.

Sprint Reviews/Demos: At the end of each sprint, demonstrate completed work and gather feedback.

Retrospectives: Regularly discuss what went well, what didn't, and how to improve the process.

Branching Strategy: Use Git with a standard branching model (e.g., Gitflow or GitHub Flow) for managing code changes.

Communication: Maintain open communication channels (e.g., Slack/Teams) for quick questions and collaboration.

7. Conclusion

Project Phoenix is an ambitious but achievable endeavor. The current engine provides a solid, albeit basic, foundation. By systematically executing this phased plan, focusing on core architectural improvements first (graphics, animation, sound, server), and then layering on features and polish, we can transform this engine into a truly competitive platform. This document will serve as our living guide, evolving as we progress and learn. Let the transformation begin!
