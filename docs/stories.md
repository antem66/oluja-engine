Okay, here are Epics and Feature Stories based on the Production-Ready Slot Engine Roadmap, designed for an Agile development process.

(Note: Priorities (M/S/C) are carried over from the roadmap for context. Acceptance Criteria (AC) are examples and would need further detail during sprint planning.)

Epic 1: Engine Foundation & Tooling

Goal: Set up the project environment, development tools, and align the team for building the production engine.

Corresponds to: Roadmap Phase 0

Stories:

Story 1.1 (M): As a Development Team, I want a standardized Git branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow) documented and configured, so that code changes are managed consistently and merges are predictable.
AC: Branching strategy (main, develop, feature/, release/, hotfix/*) is documented in the project README or wiki. Repository configured with branch protection rules if applicable.
Story 1.2 (M): As a Development Team, I want a project management board (Jira, Trello, GitHub Projects) set up with initial Epics and Stories, so that work can be tracked visually and managed effectively.
AC: Board created. Roadmap Epics added. Initial high-priority stories added to the backlog.
Story 1.3 (M): As a Frontend Developer, I want the Vite build configuration reviewed and optimized for production builds (minification, code splitting, asset hashing), so that deployed assets are efficient and cacheable.
AC: vite.config.js reviewed. Production build generates optimized JS/CSS chunks. Assets have hashed filenames.
Story 1.4 (S): As a Development Team, I want a basic logging utility integrated (e.g., using console.log wrappers with levels), so that consistent and filterable logs can be generated during development and potentially in production.
AC: Logger module exists (utils/logger.js). Different log levels (debug, info, warn, error) can be used. Logs include timestamps.
Epic 2: Core Architecture & Server Foundation

Goal: Define the client-server contract, implement client-side communication, and ensure core rendering/animation foundations are solid using GSAP.

Corresponds to: Roadmap Phase 1

Stories:

Story 2.1 (M): As a Frontend Developer, I want a defined Spin API contract (request/response) agreed upon with the backend team, specifying data for spin initiation, results (stops, wins, features), and state updates, so that client-server communication can be built reliably.
AC: API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI or similar) exists for /spin and potentially /gameState endpoints. Request/Response schemas are finalized.
Story 2.2 (M): As a Frontend Developer, I want a Mock Server implementing the agreed Spin API contract, returning configurable responses (e.g., specific wins, feature triggers), so that client-side spin flow can be developed and tested independently.
AC: Mock server (Node.js script, Mockoon, etc.) is running locally. Can configure mock responses via code or UI. Returns data matching the API contract.
Story 2.3 (M): As a Frontend Developer, I want a dedicated ApiService module (src/core/ApiService.js) that centralizes all backend communication (using Workspace or WebSockets based on API design), so that API logic is isolated and easier to manage/mock.
AC: Module exists. Functions for requestSpin, getGameState (etc.) are implemented. Handles basic request/response flow with the mock server.
Story 2.4 (M): As a Frontend Developer, I want to refactor all reel stop logic (Reel.js) to exclusively use GSAP tweens initiated by scheduleStop, ensuring precise, time-based stops driven by target stop times, so that reel behaviour is smooth and predictable.
AC: Old lerpAngle/manual update logic in Reel.js is removed. Reel.update uses GSAP tween progress for effects. Stops land precisely based on scheduleStop timings.
Story 2.5 (S): As a Frontend Developer, I want to verify and refactor UI elements (buttons, panels) to use PIXI.Sprite with textures instead of PIXI.Graphics where feasible, so that rendering performance and visual consistency are improved.
AC: ButtonFactory.js primarily uses sprites (loaded SVGs/textures). Bottom UI panel potentially replaced with a sprite/9-slice plane.
Epic 3: Audio Integration

Goal: Integrate a sound engine and implement foundational audio feedback.

Corresponds to: Roadmap Phase 1

Stories:

Story 3.1 (M): As a Frontend Developer, I want to integrate an audio library (e.g., Howler.js or PixiSound) into the project, so that sound assets can be loaded and played.
AC: Library added as a dependency. Basic initialization confirmed.
Story 3.2 (M): As a Frontend Developer, I want a SoundManager.js module responsible for loading audio assets (via PIXI.Assets or library methods) and providing functions to play/stop sounds and music by key, so that audio logic is centralized.
AC: SoundManager module exists. Can load .mp3 or .wav files defined in a config. playSound('key') and playMusic('key', loop) functions exist.
Story 3.3 (S): As a Player, I want to hear basic audio feedback for essential actions (button clicks, reel spin start, individual reel stops), so that the game feels more interactive.
AC: SoundManager is called from ButtonHandlers for clicks. Game.js or Reel.js calls SoundManager for spin start/stop events. Placeholder sounds are loaded and play correctly.
Epic 4: Server-Driven Game Logic

Goal: Connect the client to the real backend, remove client-side RNG, and ensure game outcomes are dictated by the server.

Corresponds to: Roadmap Phase 2

Stories:

Story 4.1 (M): As a Frontend Developer, I want to connect ApiService to the real backend endpoint for spin requests, replacing mock calls, so that the client communicates with the authoritative game server.
AC: ApiService.requestSpin sends requests to the actual backend URL. Handles CORS if applicable. Authentication/session handling included if required by the API.
Story 4.2 (M): As a System, I want the client to receive spin results (stop indices, win details, feature triggers, balance) from the server via ApiService, so that the game outcome is determined by the server.
AC: ApiService successfully receives and parses the server's spin result response.
Story 4.3 (M): As a System, I want the reel stopping mechanism (Reel.js, Game.js) to use the stopIndex array received from the server result to schedule reel stops, removing all client-side random stop generation, so that the visual outcome matches the server-determined result.
AC: Reel.startSpinning no longer generates a random stopIndex. Game.startSpinLoop uses server results to determine target stopIndex for each reel.scheduleStop.
Story 4.4 (M): As a System, I want Win Evaluation (WinEvaluation.js) to primarily use win data (amount, lines, symbols involved) provided by the server result, validating client state against it, so that wins are authoritative and consistent with the server.
AC: evaluateWin function receives/uses server win data. Client-side line calculation might remain for visual mapping but doesn't determine the win amount. state.lastTotalWin and state.winningLinesInfo are populated based on server data.
Story 4.5 (M): As a Player, I want my balance to be updated accurately based on the balance returned by the server after each spin, so that my game credit is always correct.
AC: updateState is called with the new balance from the server response after win presentation. UIManager reflects the updated balance.
Story 4.6 (M): As a System, I want graceful error handling for API communication failures (timeouts, server errors, invalid responses), displaying user-friendly messages or attempting retries where appropriate, so that the game doesn't crash on network issues.
AC: ApiService includes try...catch blocks. Network errors are caught. Appropriate user feedback (e.g., "Connection Error" overlay) is shown. Game state remains stable or recovers (e.g., allows retrying spin).
Epic 5: Core Gameplay Presentation & Features

Goal: Implement essential features like Wilds/Scatters and enhance the visual/audio feedback for core game events.

Corresponds to: Roadmap Phase 2

Stories:

Story 5.1 (M): As a Player, I want Wild symbols to substitute for other paying symbols according to the game rules (defined by the server), so that I have more chances to win.
AC: WinEvaluation.js correctly identifies winning lines involving Wilds based on server data. Payline graphics and symbol animations highlight wins including Wilds.
Story 5.2 (M): As a Player, I want Scatter symbols to trigger features (like Free Spins) or award wins regardless of their position on paylines, based on the server result, so that I can access bonus rounds.
AC: WinEvaluation.js checks the server response for scatter counts/triggers. Scatter symbols animate distinctively when triggering features. enterFreeSpins is called based on the server trigger flag.
Story 5.3 (M): As a Player, I want a smoothly animated win counter (rollup) using GSAP, accurately reflecting the total win amount for the spin, so that win feedback is engaging.
AC: Animations.playWinAnimations uses GSAP to tween the winRollupText value from 0 to the final server-provided win amount. Static win display is hidden during rollup.
Story 5.4 (M): As a Player, I want clear visual feedback for winning lines and symbols, using GSAP timelines for coordinated line drawing and symbol animations, so that I understand how I won.
AC: PaylineGraphics.drawWinLines uses GSAP. Animations.animateWinningSymbols uses GSAP timelines. Animations are synchronized and visually clear. Custom symbol animations from the registry are triggered correctly.
Story 5.5 (S): As a Player, I want enhanced Free Spins with features like retriggers and a win multiplier (based on server logic), so that the bonus round is more exciting.
AC: FreeSpins.js logic handles retrigger conditions from server response. Wins during FS are multiplied before adding to totalFreeSpinsWin. UI clearly shows the multiplier.
Story 5.6 (S): As a Player, I want to experience anticipation effects (visual/audio slowdowns or highlights) on reels when a feature trigger is close (e.g., 2 scatters landed), so that spin outcomes are more exciting.
AC: Game.js/Reel.js implements visual/audio changes triggered by flags in the server response indicating anticipation.
Epic 6: Advanced Gameplay Mechanics (Example: Cascading Reels)

Goal: Implement a more complex, modern slot mechanic.

Corresponds to: Roadmap Phase 3 (Choose one major feature)

Stories:

Story 6.1 (S): As a System, I want the server spin result to include information about winning symbols in a cascade and the symbols that will fall in to replace them, so the client can orchestrate the cascade sequence.
AC: API contract updated for cascade results (initial win symbols, replacement symbols per column, subsequent win data if known).
Story 6.2 (S): As a Player, I want winning symbols in a cascade to animate and disappear, with symbols above falling down and new symbols appearing from the top, so that I can potentially win multiple times in one spin.
AC: WinEvaluation handles cascade logic based on server data. Animations.js includes animations for symbol removal. Reel.js or a new CascadeManager handles symbol dropping/replacement logic using GSAP.
Story 6.3 (S): As a Player, I want subsequent wins within a single cascade sequence to be evaluated and animated correctly, adding to the total spin win, so that the chain reactions are rewarding.
AC: Game loop waits for cascade animations to finish before evaluating the next cascade step based on server data (or triggers next server call if required). Win counter updates progressively.
Epic 7: Bonus Feature Implementation (Example: Pick-Me Bonus)

Goal: Implement an interactive bonus round.

Corresponds to: Roadmap Phase 3

Stories:

Story 7.1 (S): As a System, I want the server spin result to indicate when a Pick-Me bonus is triggered and potentially provide initial state/options for the bonus, so the client can initiate the feature.
AC: API contract includes bonus trigger flags and bonus-specific data structures.
Story 7.2 (S): As a Player, I want to be transitioned to a distinct Bonus Game screen when the Pick-Me bonus is triggered, featuring selectable items, so that I know I'm in the bonus round.
AC: New PIXI container/scene for the bonus game. Smooth transition animation (fade/zoom) from base game. Background/music changes.
Story 7.3 (S): As a Player, I want to click on selectable items in the Pick-Me bonus, revealing prizes (win amounts, multipliers, or 'collect'), so that I can interact with the bonus.
AC: Items are interactive (eventMode='static'). Click triggers communication with the server (ApiService.makeBonusPick(itemId)).
Story 7.4 (S): As a System, I want the client to receive the outcome of a bonus pick from the server (prize amount, if bonus continues/ends), so that the bonus progression is controlled by the server.
AC: ApiService handles bonus pick responses. Client updates UI based on the server response (revealing prize, disabling item).
Story 7.5 (S): As a Player, I want to see a summary of my total bonus win and be transitioned back to the base game when the Pick-Me bonus ends, so the feature concludes clearly.
AC: Bonus end condition detected from server response. Summary screen/overlay displayed. Transition animation back to base game. Base game state (balance) updated.
Epic 8: Presentation Polish & "Juice"

Goal: Significantly enhance visual and audio feedback to make the game feel more alive and rewarding.

Corresponds to: Roadmap Phase 3

Stories:

Story 8.1 (M): As a Player, I want elaborate "Big Win" / "Mega Win" sequences with unique animations, sounds, and effects (e.g., coin showers using pixi-particles), so that large wins feel impactful and exciting.
AC: Animations.playWinAnimations triggers distinct, multi-stage GSAP timelines for different win thresholds. pixi-particles integrated and used for coin effects. Custom sound events triggered.
Story 8.2 (S): As a Player, I want more dynamic and engaging audio, including symbol-specific win sounds, richer ambient background music that changes between game states (base, FS, bonus), and satisfying UI interaction sounds, so the game is more immersive.
AC: SoundManager library expanded with more sounds. Game events trigger a wider variety of sounds. Music tracks loop and transition smoothly. Volume controls implemented.
Story 8.3 (S): As a Player, I want smooth transitions between game states (e.g., Base Game <-> Free Spins, Base Game <-> Bonus), using fades, zooms, or other effects, so the experience feels seamless.
AC: GSAP used to animate container alpha/scale/position during state changes (FreeSpins.js, Bonus logic).
Story 8.4 (C): As a Player, I want subtle idle animations on symbols or background elements, so the game feels less static when waiting for input.
AC: Simple, non-intrusive GSAP animations added to symbol sprites or background elements that play when the game is idle.
Epic 9: Mobile Experience Enhancement

Goal: Ensure the game looks and performs well on mobile devices.

Corresponds to: Roadmap Phase 3

Stories:

Story 9.1 (S): As a Mobile Player, I want the UI layout (buttons, text displays) to adapt correctly to different screen aspect ratios and sizes, so that the game is playable and looks good on my device.
AC: Game tested on various iOS/Android devices/emulators. UI elements resize/reposition gracefully. No overlapping or cutoff elements.
Story 9.2 (S): As a Mobile Player, I want the game performance (spin smoothness, animations) to be acceptable on mid-range mobile devices, so that the experience is enjoyable.
AC: Performance profiled on target mobile devices. Optimizations implemented (draw call reduction, texture memory management) if needed to meet performance targets (e.g., >30fps).
Story 9.3 (S): As a Mobile Player, I want touch interactions for buttons to be responsive and reliable, so that I can control the game easily.
AC: Button pointer events work correctly with touch input. No significant lag or missed taps.
Epic 10: Engine Testing & Quality Assurance

Goal: Implement automated tests to ensure engine stability and prevent regressions.

Corresponds to: Roadmap Phase 4

Stories:

Story 10.1 (M): As a Developer, I want a Unit Testing framework (e.g., Vitest, Jest) set up and configured, so that I can write and run unit tests for individual modules.
AC: Framework installed. Test runner configured in package.json. Example unit test passes.
Story 10.2 (M): As a Developer, I want Unit Tests written for critical utility functions and configuration parsing logic, so that core non-visual components are verified.
AC: Tests cover functions in utils/helpers.js, config loading/validation logic. Aim for >70% coverage on tested files.
Story 10.3 (S): As a Developer, I want an E2E Testing framework (e.g., Cypress, Playwright) set up, so that I can write tests simulating user interactions across the entire application.
AC: Framework installed. Basic configuration complete. Example E2E test runs successfully against the dev server.
Story 10.4 (S): As a Developer, I want E2E Tests covering the core user flows (launch game, change bet, perform a spin, trigger free spins, complete free spins), so that major regressions in functionality can be caught automatically.
AC: E2E tests exist for listed flows. Tests verify key UI changes and state updates (e.g., balance change, FS counter). Tests run reliably.
Epic 11: Production Robustness & Security

Goal: Harden the engine for production deployment, focusing on error handling, state recovery, and security basics.

Corresponds to: Roadmap Phase 4

Stories:

Story 11.1 (M): As a System, I want comprehensive error handling around all critical operations (API calls, state updates, rendering loop), logging detailed error information, so that issues can be diagnosed and stability is improved.
AC: try...catch blocks implemented widely. Errors logged with context. Consider integration with an external error reporting service (Sentry).
Story 11.2 (S): As a System, I want the client to gracefully handle game state recovery after a page refresh or disconnection, fetching the latest authoritative state from the server upon reload, so that players don't lose their game progress.
AC: On initial load/reload, client calls a server endpoint (/gameState?) to get current balance, active feature state (FS remaining?), etc. Client UI updates to reflect fetched state.
Story 11.3 (S): As a Security Auditor, I want to review the client-server communication flow, ensuring no game-critical decisions rely solely on client-side data and that sensitive information isn't unnecessarily exposed, so that basic cheating vectors are mitigated.
AC: Code review performed focusing on API request/response handling. No sensitive logic (e.g., win calculation override) exists client-side.
Epic 12: Game Developer Experience & Tooling

Goal: Make it easy and efficient for developers to create new games using the engine.

Corresponds to: Roadmap Phase 4

Stories:

Story 12.1 (M): As a Game Developer, I want clear documentation explaining the engine architecture, how to configure a new game (symbols, reels, payouts, features via config/), add assets, and potentially extend features, so that I can build new games efficiently.
AC: Markdown documentation exists covering engine setup, configuration files, asset requirements, SoundManager usage, AnimationRegistry, and basic feature extension points.
Story 12.2 (S): As a Game Developer, I want validation tooling (e.g., scripts, type checking if using TS) for game configuration files, so that errors in configuration are caught early during development.
AC: Script (npm run validate-config?) exists to check structure and basic values in config/ files. Errors are reported clearly.
Story 12.3 (S): As a Game Developer, I want a defined process for skinning/theming the game (replacing background, symbol textures, UI assets, button styles, fonts), so that visual variations can be created easily.
AC: Documentation outlines which assets/CSS variables/config settings control the theme. Example demonstrates changing the visual theme.
Story 12.4 (C): As a Game Developer, I want a simple UI tool or CLI to generate boilerplate configuration files for a new game, so that initial setup is faster.
AC: Tool exists that prompts for basic game info and generates template config/ files.
This breakdown provides a structured backlog of work to guide the development towards a production-ready slot engine. Remember to refine stories and add detailed Acceptance Criteria during sprint planning.
