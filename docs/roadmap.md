Okay, based on the analysis of your "Heavens Ten Deluxe" project and the "Project Phoenix" vision document, here is a potential roadmap to evolve it into a fully working, production-ready slot engine.

This roadmap expands upon the phases outlined in docs/project.md, adding detail and focusing on production requirements like server integration, robustness, and tooling.

Core Principles for Production Readiness:

Server Authority: All critical game logic, especially Random Number Generation (RNG), win validation, and state management, must reside on a secure server. The client is primarily for presentation and user input.
Robustness: The engine must handle errors gracefully, maintain state consistency, and perform reliably.
Security: Protect against cheating and unauthorized actions.
Performance: Smooth animations and responsiveness across target devices (desktop & mobile).
Scalability: Architecture should facilitate the creation of multiple, diverse games using the engine.
Maintainability: Code should be clean, tested, and well-documented.
Roadmap: Phoenix Engine (Production)

Phase 0: Preparation & Foundation Alignment (Estimate: 1-2 Weeks)

Objective: Ensure team alignment, tool setup, and review the existing plan.
Key Tasks:
Team Review: Discuss this roadmap and the project.md vision with all stakeholders (devs, potentially designers, product owners).
Backend Collaboration: Establish clear communication channels and initial technical discussions with the backend team responsible for the RNG server.
Tooling Setup:
Confirm Vite build configurations for development and production (minification, chunking, asset handling).
Set up version control (Git) with a clear branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow).
Establish project management tools (Jira, Trello, GitHub Projects as suggested in project.md).
Code Review: Perform a quick review of the existing codebase against the project.md analysis to confirm the starting state.
Phase 1: Core Architecture & Server/Audio Foundation (Estimate: 4-8 Weeks)

Objective: Integrate foundational audio, solidify rendering/animation, define the server API, and build client-side communication layers with a mock server.
Key Tasks:
(M) Server API Definition: Collaborate with the backend team to define the precise request/response structure for:
Spin initiation (bet amount, session info).
Spin result reception (stop positions, win amounts, winning lines, features triggered, updated balance).
(Potentially) Game configuration loading, player state synchronization.
(M) Mock Server Implementation: Create a simple local mock server (or use tools like Mockoon/Postman mock servers) that returns predictable/configurable results based on the defined API. This allows parallel client/backend development.
(M) Client API Layer: Create a dedicated module (src/core/ApiService.js or similar) to handle all communication with the (mock) backend. Abstract Workspace or WebSocket logic here.
(M) Audio Engine Integration:
Integrate Howler.js or PixiSound.
Create SoundManager.js responsible for loading and playing sounds/music triggered by game events.
Implement basic sound loading via PIXI.Assets.
Add initial essential sounds (button clicks, basic reel spin/stop).
(M) GSAP Refinement: Ensure all dynamic animations (reels, UI transitions, win counts) consistently use GSAP. Verify the Reel.js stop tweening logic is robust and smooth using GSAP.
(S) Rendering Verification: Double-check that all game elements (symbols, buttons, UI panels if complex) are using PIXI.Sprite with textures where appropriate, minimizing PIXI.Graphics for dynamic elements.
(S) Basic Logging/Error Handling: Implement a simple logging strategy and basic try...catch blocks around critical operations (API calls, core loop).
Phase 2: Full Server Integration & Core Gameplay Loop (Estimate: 6-10 Weeks)

Objective: Connect the client to the real backend server, adapt game logic to be server-driven, implement core win presentation, and add essential gameplay features.
Key Tasks:
(M) Real Server Connection: Replace mock API calls in ApiService.js with actual communication to the live backend endpoint(s). Handle asynchronous responses, loading states, and potential network errors.
(M) Server-Driven Logic:
Modify Game.js / ButtonHandlers.js: startSpin now calls ApiService to request a spin from the server.
Modify Reel.js / Game.js: Use the stopIndex array received from the server result to scheduleStop for each reel. Remove all client-side RNG for stop positions.
Modify WinEvaluation.js: Use the win amount, winning lines, and feature triggers provided by the server result. Client-side evaluation might remain for identifying which symbols on screen correspond to the server-defined win, but the validity and amount of the win come from the server.
(M) State Synchronization: Implement logic to ensure client state (balance, free spins remaining) aligns with the authoritative state received from the server after each spin.
(M) Core Win Presentation (GSAP):
Refine Animations.js and PaylineGraphics.js.
Implement smooth, GSAP-timeline-based sequences for win line display, symbol animations (using the registry), and the win amount rollup counter.
(M) Core Soundscape: Implement distinct sounds for reel stops (per reel), small/medium/large wins, feature triggers (scatter land, FS entry).
(S) Wild Symbol Logic: Implement basic Wild substitution logic in WinEvaluation.js (visual part, based on server result).
(S) Scatter Pays/Triggers: Handle scatter wins and Free Spins triggering based purely on server results.
(S) Enhanced Free Spins: Implement retriggers and multipliers based on server communication/results. Refine entry/exit transitions (using GSAP). Add distinct FS background music loop via SoundManager.
(S) Anticipation Effects: Implement reel slowdowns/effects (visual & audio) for near-miss scatter/bonus landings, potentially triggered by flags in the server response.
Phase 3: Feature Expansion & Presentation Polish ("Juice") (Estimate: 8-12 Weeks)

Objective: Implement more advanced gameplay mechanics and significantly enhance the visual and auditory feedback to create a more engaging player experience.
Key Tasks:
(S) Major Gameplay Feature: Implement one significant modern mechanic (e.g., Cascading/Tumbling Reels, Expanding Wilds, Basic Ways-to-Win evaluation) based on server capabilities. Requires significant changes to WinEvaluation and potentially Reel.js.
(S) Basic Bonus Game: Implement a simple bonus feature like a Pick-Me game (new screen/state, interaction logic, server communication for picks/results).
(M) Enhanced Win Celebrations:
Develop multi-stage "Big Win"/"Mega Win" sequences using GSAP Timelines, incorporating advanced particle effects, custom sounds, and more elaborate text/background animations.
Integrate pixi-particles or a similar library for more complex particle effects (coin showers, explosions).
(S) Audio Deep Dive: Add symbol-specific win sounds, anticipation sounds, UI feedback sounds, ambient background loops, and dynamic audio changes based on game state (e.g., intensity during features). Implement volume controls.
(S) UI/UX Refinement:
Implement a polished, interactive Paytable screen.
Create a clear Game Rules screen.
Refine bet controls (e.g., separate coin value/level).
Improve overall UI skin/theme.
(S) Mobile Responsiveness & Optimization: Thoroughly test on target mobile devices. Adapt layout and optimize performance specifically for mobile browsers (draw calls, texture memory).
(C) Advanced Wilds: Implement Sticky, Walking, or Multiplier Wilds (requires server support).
(C) Subtle Polish: Add small animations to UI elements, reel spin/stop flourishes (squash/stretch), idle animations.
Phase 4: Production Hardening & Developer Experience (Estimate: 6-9 Weeks)

Objective: Ensure the engine is robust, secure, testable, performant, and easy for developers to create new games with.
Key Tasks:
(M) Comprehensive Testing:
Unit Tests: Implement unit tests (using Jest, Vitest, or similar) for core logic modules (e.g., utility functions, configuration parsing, non-visual parts of state management).
Integration Tests: Test the interaction between key modules (e.g., Spin Request -> ApiService -> Mock Server -> State Update -> Win Eval).
End-to-End (E2E) Tests: Use a framework like Cypress or Playwright to simulate user interactions (clicking spin, changing bet, triggering features) and verify visual/state outcomes.
(M) Robust Error Handling: Implement comprehensive error handling for API calls, rendering issues, state inconsistencies. Consider integrating an error reporting service (e.g., Sentry).
(M) State Management Resilience: Design how the client handles page refreshes or temporary disconnections (e.g., requesting current state from the server on reconnection).
(S) Security Review: Focus on client-server communication. Ensure no sensitive operations rely solely on client-side data. Sanitize any user input (though minimal in slots).
(S) Performance Optimization: Profile the application on target devices. Optimize rendering (draw calls, batching), code execution, memory usage. Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects like particles or symbols if necessary. Optimize production build sizes.
(S) Compliance Hooks: Add configuration options and potential code hooks to support responsible gaming features (session limits, loss limits, reality checks) and jurisdiction-specific requirements (displaying certain info, specific delays). These often need server-side enforcement but require client UI.
(M) Game Configuration Tooling: Define a clear process or develop simple tools/scripts to help developers configure new games (defining symbols, payouts, reel strips, feature variations) without modifying engine code directly.
(M) Engine Documentation: Finalize documentation specifically for game developers explaining how to use the engine, configure games, add assets, and implement custom features.
Phase 5: Deployment & Continuous Improvement (Ongoing)

Objective: Deploy games built with the engine and establish processes for ongoing maintenance and feature additions.
Key Tasks:
Deployment Pipeline: Set up CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
Production Monitoring: Implement logging and performance monitoring in the production environment.
Versioning: Maintain clear versioning for the engine and individual games.
Game Development Workflow: Utilize the engine to build and launch actual slot game titles.
Feedback Loop: Gather feedback from players, developers, and stakeholders to inform future engine improvements and feature prioritization.
Maintenance: Address bugs, update dependencies, and refactor code as needed.
Important Considerations:

Backend Dependency: This roadmap heavily relies on a capable and synchronized backend team. API definition and integration are critical paths.
Team Resources: Estimates depend on the size and experience of the development team.
Compliance: Regulatory requirements vary significantly by jurisdiction and must be factored in early, likely influencing server-side logic and client-side UI hooks.
Scope Creep: Stick to the defined phases. New features should be considered for later iterations unless critical.
Design Input: UI/UX polish and thematic elements will require input from designers.
This roadmap provides a structured path towards a production-ready engine, building upon the existing foundation and addressing the key requirements for a real-world slot product. Remember to adapt it based on specific business priorities and resource availability.
